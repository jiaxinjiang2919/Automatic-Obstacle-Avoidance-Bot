# Automatic-Obstacle-Avoidance-Bot
• Designed the circuit of the bot based on a microcontroller with WiFi Communication built-in. Used infrared sensors to test the obstacle and utilized the ultrasonic module(HC-SR04) to decide which direction the cart should turn to. Determined the direction of roatation based on teh data collected. Collect and filter the terminal Wifi signal. • Used ESP8266 WiFI module to receive the signal strength of the WiFi beacon. Designed an addressing algorithm to help the car navigate according to the strength of the Wifi signal to avoid obstacles eventually navigate through an obstacle course successfully. • Used: Arduino,ESP8266.
